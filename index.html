<i>Resume Sample 1 follows the basic resume format of a fresh college grad with a web design background. This basic resume format is ideal for those who are applying for entry level jobs and can easily fit in a single page. Refer to Resume Rample 2 (entry level web developer) and Resume Sample 3 (Entry Level IT Support Specialist) for fresh graduate resumes with longer format.
</i>

<b>Resume Writing Tip:</b>When <a href="http://thehbcucareercenter.com/resumes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing a resume</a>, it is important to filter out the details you include and choose only the information that is relevant to the position you are apply for. Most fresh graduates are prone to the mistake of cramming every single detail in their resume without necessarily considering which information is relevant and which isn't. Your resume's purpose is to showcase your knowledge, skills and experience that will convince your potential employer that you are the right fit for the job. As a general rule, eliminate any information that doesn't serve that purpose.
